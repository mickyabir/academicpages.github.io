Getting started with current web dev trends feels nearly impossible these days, but thankfully there are an unprecedented number of helpful guides and discussions out there.

Going from crazy hours during my M.S. to a summer of relatively little work has been quite the transition, and to fill the time I have been focusing on improving my industry skills and toying with startup ideas. I remember playing around with Node.js as a freshman at hackathons back in 2014, but since then I haven't even considered web dev as an interest until recently. Back then I tested the waters with the MEAN stack (MongoDB + Express + Angular + Node), and even prior to that I tried out the classic [LAMP stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)).

These days, I'm trying to really get up to date with the current stacks and technologies, and have landed on the [MERN stack](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mern-stack/), with [D3](https://d3js.org) for visuzliations, and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) for UI prototyping. I have two goals for myself - scale and security. I've been focusing on good practices for both, both technologically and architecturally, but I find the former is becoming increasingly bloated. You want to try and build a REST api? Great, but how does GraphQL fit in? Trying to start a new web app? You _must_ be using react, and might as well use materials-ui or ant design (since apparently Bootstrap isn't the best anymore?). I won't pretend to know the best tools or frameworks for the job, but at least I found a good starting point for those, like me, who are very new to the field.

Check out [Developer Roadmaps](https://roadmap.sh) to get started.

I should also mention that while I had a hard time getting started with React, I definitely grew to like it. For visualizations, D3 always shows up, and for good reason. Interactive visualizations have never been more exciting!
