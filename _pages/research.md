IMPL
======
**IMP** + **L**ists, or **IMPL**, is an imperative programming language based on the **IMP** programming language, with the addition of Lists over Natural numbers. In this project, we design and implement the continuation-style semantics of **IMPL** using [Maude](http://maude.cs.illinois.edu/w/index.php/The_Maude_System). With the correct-by-construction executable semantics at hand, we create a prover for **IMPL** programs using the constructor-based reachability logic prover and study the proof methodology of such proofs. This tool is used as a teaching tool in CS 476 at UIUC.
