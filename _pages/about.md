I am a an incoming first-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at UCLA under Professor [Jens Palsberg](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~palsberg/). Previously, I have graduated from [UIUC](https://cs.illinois.edu) with a B.S. in Computer Engineering in 2018, and with an M.S. in Computer Science in 2020.

While at UIUC, I worked on the [K Framework](http://www.kframework.org) under Professor Grigore Rosu, where I implemented the I/O and FFI interfaces in the LLVM backend, implemented and tested pattern matching heuristics, and helped transition projects to the LLVM backend. I also worked with Professor Jose Meseguer on **IMPL** and its prover, found [here](http://mickyabir.com/research/).

I was born in Israel and moved to Illinois when I was around 10, and have stayed in Illinois to earn my two degrees. English and Hebrew are my native languages, but I also have an intermediate understanding of Japanese. My hobbies tend to shift frequently, from video games and bad reality TV shows, to music, drawing, and reading. Lately I have been especially interested in data analytics and visualization, for which I am constantly prototyping new projects with the [MERN Stack](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mern-stack/).
