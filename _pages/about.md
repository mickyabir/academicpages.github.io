I am a an incoming first-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at UCLA under Professor [Jens Palsberg](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~palsberg/). Previously, I have graduated from [UIUC](https://cs.illinois.edu) with a B.S. in Computer Engineering in 2018, and with an M.S. in Computer Science in 2020.

While at UIUC, I worked on the [K Framework](http://www.kframework.org) under Professor Grigore Rosu, where I implemented the I/O and FFI interfaces in the LLVM backend, implemented and tested pattern matching heuristics, and helped transition projects to the LLVM backend.
